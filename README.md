### Welcome to my Github repositories

Feel free to clone or contribute to any of the repositories if you find them useful. But be warned, the quality and maturity of the code ranges from *"works for me"* to *"other people use it, too"*. Some code may not even work at all.

Please note that Emma May (starhawking) has taken over the [python-terrascript](https://github.com/starhawking/python-terrascript) project.
